# calculator-embedded-wizard
A project implemented using Embedded Wizard 13. 

For executing operations (so far: *addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, percentage*), either the device's **physical keyboard** or the **virtual** one can be used. The application handles key events using PushButtons (virtual) and a KeyPressHandler (physical). 

All the buttons integrated into the virtual keyboard are customized using the Face Bitmap property and change their appearance when pressed (the FaceFrame changes when in or out of focus).
